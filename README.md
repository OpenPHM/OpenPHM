# Welcome to OpenPHM!
This repository is dedicated to PHM -- Prognostics & Health Management.

We are currently implementing a data model dedicated to one of PHM's major aspects:
* Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM)
* Predictive Maintenance (PdM)


We plan to publish a first version late 2023 or early 2024.




## About the project
We are implementing a data model that is compliant to the logical architecture of CBM systems as defined in ISO 13374.

The implementation will be available in multiple languages enabling the flexible implementation of powerful, distributed CBM systems.

Meanwhile, please refer to our website for some more information: [Hamburg PHM](https://www.hamburg-phm.com)
